## Laravel RESTful API
I was searching for basic auth based RESTful application on Laravel or Lumen. I was trying to learn React & Redux. But could not find any. Was lazy enough to build a new one. As nothing did help me, have to write one for myself. Use it for free. Make changes & send PRs.
Intentionally, it is for REST purpose. Can consume the API by mobile or front-end applications.
